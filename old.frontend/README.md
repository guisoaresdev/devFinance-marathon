Update 2024-07-27: 
This was my very first project that I did, back in 2021 in a very cool marathon from Rockseat. I've spend some time doing other stuff, but then i asked myself: "What if i try to make a very cool minimalist application with real usage? And maybe even turn this into a very cool real product".
